# Python-Lessons

Python Lessons

This folder has code snippets for all my Python lessons that I use in the classroom for students from Year 7 to Year 13. The idea was to have ready examples of code for each segment when I visit different classrooms, so I am not struggling to think of relevant ideas when I need it right away, or get confused ( especially when I do a lot of Arduino teaching) with syntax. 

Please feel free to use and add/modify to suit.
